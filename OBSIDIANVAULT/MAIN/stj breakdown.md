I am creating an app designed to do 3 main things.

1.) it is a trade journal, you can upload a csv file from major trade platforms that will automnatically translate to show your trading stats. including winrate average trade length pnl and other basic things. think of tradezella or tradenote https://github.com/Eleven-Trading/TradeNote
2.) it will be a socail platform. so tradesrs trading journal and pnl will be public so everyone to see. you will be able to post videos images and regular text. 
3.) gurus will be able to sell there courses on my platform. the public trading journal will give credability to the guru
