topic the evolution of communication technologies 

	Intro / hook
In this day in age you have the abaility to send most forms of information within the spand of less then a second across the whole world. weather this be a tiktok, email, or classified millitary documents. the freedom of communcaition we have now is often taken for granted when we forget what it was like to communicate it the past.


	The start
1. People often assume that cave paintings are the first form of communication, but people often gloss over one main one which is speach
2.  Ancient humans were not speaking like a modern day human, there was no brainrot, atcually there was no languge at all. simple grunts, screams and hums were enough to get the point across.
3. But the first form of communication technology were cave paintings, simple paintings made with mud, flowers, and crushed bugs were slathered onto walls to display stories and give warnings to others
	- ***use words, firstly, however and over look. ***


	The letter

1.  a few million years later we developed language and with languge came writing though ancient writing may not have been words in the sense that we see it as now, writing allowed people to communicate to a better extent then cave paintings. 
2. With the introduction of writing, came the need to send these words to people far away, thus mail was introduced. When mail became populraized by the ancient egyptions it could take weeks or months for the information to be delivered it was still a step in the right direction

	from ancient to modern.
1. Now lets go to the modern age. after thousands of years of the evolution of mail, and the creation of the post office in the united states, there was another advancement glooming on the surface. 
2. The creation of the phone was on the horizon, alexander grahm bell invited the first telephone. this allowed people to talk to people across distances never imagined before. this sparked more inovation, thus a hundred years later the development of the computer and shortly following the world wide web as well as the cell phone changed the way we communicate for ever.
