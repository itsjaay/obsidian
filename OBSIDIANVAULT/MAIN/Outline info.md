SAMPLE SENTENCE OUTLINE FOR INFORMATIVE  
SPEECH  
Tornadoes  
I. **Introduction**  
A. **Attention Getter**: What can hurdle automobiles through the air, rip ordinary homes  
to shreds, defeather chickens, and travel at speeds over 60mph?  
B. Relevance: Illinois rests on the boundary of what tornado researchers call tornado  
alley. This is the area of the country that receives the most tornadoes every year.  
According to a 1995 brochure distributed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration (NOAA), Illinois averages 27 tornadoes a year. Also, nearly five  
people die every year in Illinois as a result of tornadoes [Visual Aid]. In fact,  
according to Tornado Project Online!, a website hosted by a company that gathers  
tornado information for tornado researchers that I accessed earlier this month, the  
deadliest tornado in U.S. recorded history occurred in Murphysboro, Illinois. In  
1925, a violent tornado killed 234 people in this Southern Illinois town.  
C. **Credibility**: I grew up in the heart of tornado alley and have been interested in this  
weather phenomenon for a very long time. Also, I am a trained weather spotter for  
the Bloomington/Normal civil defense agency.  
D. Thesis: In order to better understand tornadoes, it is important to explore what  
causes tornadoes to develop, how researchers classify types of tornadoes, and odd  
occurrences that may be associated with tornadoes.  
E. **Preview of main points**: So, let us crash through the causes of tornadoes, twist  
around the types of tornadoes, and blow through some of the oddities associated  
with tornadoes.  
**Transition**: Initially, I will crash through the causes of tornadoes.  
II. **Body**  
A. There are several causes of tornadoes.  
1. According to the USA Today Tornado Information website, which  
was last updated on June 20, 2000, a tornado is a “violently rotating  
column of air in contact with the ground and pendant from a  
thunderstorm.” Therefore, thunderstorms are the first step in the  
creation of a tornado.  
2. The USA Today Tornado Information site also indicates that there  
are three key conditions for thunderstorms to form.  
a. First, moisture in the lower to mid levels of the  
atmosphere.  
b. Second, unstable air. This is air that will continue rising  
once it begins rising from near the ground.  
c. The final condition for the formation of tornado-producing  
thunderstorms is a lifting force. A lifting force is a  
mechanism that cause air to begin rising. The most  
common lifting force is heating of the air (which is why we  
experience so many thunderstorms in the spring as the air  
begins to warm).  
3. The same source indicates that the strongest thunderstorms  
typically form in the warm, humid air that’s east or south of  
advancing cold air.
