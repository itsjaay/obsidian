1. - [ ] In depth team builder with preferred roles, coach slots, and sub slots.(and owner),
    
    _Also add a admin spot so you can have someone else help manage the team scrims and whatnot_
    
    - [ ] LMS system (a system to search for scrims at the last minute, you choose the things your looking for, or leave it blank and then you wait),
    
    _This is awesome, I would suggest we have it where you can basically take the gamble to play against much less fair team but gives a higher chance of finding a scrim in those few minutes_
    
    - [ ] lft and lfp (looking for team and looking for player) tabs. players put out there information like what role they play and their rank and experiences and what they want to do weather that is premier or if that is tournament play. and teams put out post where they look for players coaches and subs. they say the rank of their team and what they plan to do weather that is premier or tournaments and any other information,
    1
    - This is where I have the most to say. I want a proper system for finding and looking for teams. Firstly I think that every team should have the ability to post that they are looking for a player and all that. But I want to have built in form systems. Instead of a terrible DM chat system, I want all players applying to a LFP to have to go through a built in form. That way teams actually can pick and choose who they send a message/invite to join.,
    
    For the LFT system, I think something valuable would yes be able to post you're looking for a team. But also have something that uses the filters, rank, other preferences you selected and suggest teams to join automatically so that both the player have a better shot at finding a team and also teams that are looking get more exposure* I have more to say on this but just will leave it there for now.
    
    - [ ] LFG, find people to play ranked with pretty simple. players say their rank and what role they play and whether they want a long term duo trio or 5 stack or just something to run for the night.,
    
    _Not much to note here. I think this would be a feature we have to have because it'll bring more traction to the website, I do think having a review system for players would be good to give insight on if this player is worth having in your five stack_
    
    - [ ] custom ranked system, similar to faciet but solely for valorant. you get an Elo and it is firstly based off your rank, then it changes based off your performance in game. later on we will verify based off your valorant tracker to prevent smurfing but just for now we will worry about that later.,
    
    _I'd love this system for teams too. Like showing off your teams performance and elo would be nice. Maybe even have a team leaderboard to kinda get your team more traction based off of how well you do in scrims and in Premier. Not sure exactly how it would work but would be nice and is currently missing from Premier, also could lead to hosting our own tournaments with top teams_
		# idea for actuals games that can be scheduled for a team ELO system, you will schedule a time and that is it. you will have no say in the map or who your are against (though they will be in a similar elo as your team)
    
    - [ ] link to discord and link to valorant tracker. this way it will make it easier to confirm ranks or if a rank of a player changes it will updated automatically.,
    
    _This is a must_
    
    - [ ] login and signup page.,
    - [ ] "Pro Scrims" and "Micro Leagues" (tournaments). pro scrims will be a place for t1 and t2 teams to scrim in a more professional environment. there will be a verification process and once they are verified they will be able to make LFS in the pro scrims area.,
    - [ ] micro leagues will be tournaments similar to premier. how it will work exactly is to be decided later but I want a tab for them for team owners. (open to all ranks, doesn't have to qualify for pro scrims),
    
    *Notes on pro area and micro league. Lots of cool stuff, this gives off pro city vibes. I think just engaging with T3 and T2 teams and getting them to want to compete in our own "league" so they can earn their way to more high skill tournaments is cool.

    I would love to have it so that if you are at a certain threshold you can enter for free to be apart of the "micro league or t3 or whatever" and compete in our own tournaments and such. Then if you win enough of them not only will prizes happen, but I think giving them "pro scrim" access is a nice way of saying we want you to go pro so here is more tools and rewards to get there.

    And yes the process of verification and just having a space for pro teams and T2 teams already built will be good to have and is a must if we want to get bigger names involved
